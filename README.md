# Market Research Example

I was looking back through some files and found a prompt for designing a hypothetical market research scenario. It looked like a good way to work on presenting information using different style markdowns, so I went a little overboard. The study design would likely be changed a few times along the way, but this seems like a decent framework for showing knowledge of research design for job applications and the like.

# Prompt

The prompt was repetitive so I made a presentation to display the most important parts of the hypothetical study.
